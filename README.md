# My freeCodeCamp Daily Challenge completions

## Purpose/Disclaimer

I am NOT a programmer.  My career has always been more infrastructure focused, but I do often rely on code for automation, API calls, Infrastructure as Code, and just tinkering around.  

The more time goes on I find myself relying more on AI for quick solutions and that old part of my brain that used to know things struggles to remember how to do things.  I am a firm believer if you "don't use it, you loose it", and with any programming language I have been half decent at, if I take a break from it I feel lost when I need to start a new project with it.

After completing this year's Advent of Code, I realized I need a daily challenge to keep my mind sharp.  freeCodeCamp.org seem to do the trick.  So my goal is to complete the Daily Challenge as often as I can and post the solutions publicly -- Not for the world to judge my code (although, please feel free as it's the only way I will learn), but to keep myself "honest" that I am trying to complete my goals.

Please do not try to learn anything from my code.  I am certain there are better methods to complete the challenges.
